I'm Gustavo Adolfo Rodriguez, a passionate Software Engineer and Salsa music lover. I live in Cali, Colombia, and work for [Perficient](https://www.perficient.com), but this blog, its content, and opinions are my own.

I've worked as a Software Engineer for more than a decade and I'm currently deeply invested in all things Java Cloud-Native development.
